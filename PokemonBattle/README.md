# Pokémon Battle Game

This is a simple text-based Pokémon battle game written in Python. The game allows you to choose from three random Pokémon and compete against a randomly generated opponent's Pokémon. You'll select a stat to compare, and the Pokémon with the higher stat wins the round. The first player to score 3 points wins the game.


Requirements:
Python 3
random module
requests module



How to Play:
Run the code using a Python interpreter.
You will be given three Pokémon to choose from.
The game will display the current round and ask you to select a Pokémon and a stat to compare.
Enter the number corresponding to your Pokémon choice (1, 2, or 3).
Enter the number corresponding to the stat you want to compare:
1: Physical stat
2: Magic stat
3: Special ability stat
The opponent's Pokémon and its corresponding stat will be randomly generated.
The battle begins! The game will count down from 3, displaying your Pokémon's attack and the opponent's attack.
The winner of the round is determined based on the comparison of the selected stats. If your stat is higher, you win; otherwise, the opponent wins. In case of a tie, the round is declared a draw.
The game will display the current score: your score and the opponent's score.
If neither player has scored 3 points yet, the next round will start automatically.
The game continues until one player reaches a score of 3 points, at which point the final results will be displayed.



How to Restart the Game


After finishing a game, you will be prompted to play again. If you enter "yes," the game will reset, and a new tournament will begin with three new Pokémon choices. If you enter "no," the game will end, and the program will terminate.
Please note that the Pokémon choices and stats are randomly generated using the PokeAPI, ensuring a different experience in each game.
Enjoy the Pokémon battle tournament!
